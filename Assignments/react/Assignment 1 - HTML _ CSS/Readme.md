# Assignment 1 - Graphic Art Library

## The challenge

Your assignment is to create frontend using HTML, CSS and some Javascript in HTML.

Your users should be able to:

- See all graphic art images
- Like or dislike all images
- Design should be mobile friendly (resposive)

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the designs inside the `/design-preview` folder.

In this challenge, you will find mobile and desktop designs.

The designs are in PNG static format. This will mean that you'll need to use your best judgment for styles such as `font-size`, `padding` and `margin`. This should help train your eye to perceive differences in spacings and sizes.

The assets are in the `/assets` folder and you can use any icon library for the icons.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
