# Assignment 3 - React intro, Version Control, JSX & Routing

## The challenge

Your assignment is to create a basic React App, Setup Routing for multiple pages and setup local and remote repositories for the app.

## Task

1. Create a folder named `Assignment-3`.
2. Go into that folder using terminal and initialize a git repo.
3. Create a basic React app in that folder.
4. Commit the current code & create a new branch called `dev`.
5. Go to the new branch you just created and create basic project structure of react app.
6. You are going to setup different routes for `Login Page`, `Register Page`, `Homepage`, `Atwork Detail Page`, `Cart Page` and `Checkout Page`. You are free to create your own design for this assignment.
7. Create components for all the pages mentioned above and use the project sturcture you created before.
8. For `Homepage`, you are going to convert your code that you wrote in your first HTML & CSS Assignment into react code. So, your homepage will show all the artworks.
9. `Atwork Detail Page` should show all the details of the first artwork (image, title, description, genre, price, add to cart button). Whenever you click on any product from homepage, it should redirect to this page. Currently, even if you click on 2nd or 3rd artwork, it will show the details of 1st artwork only. We will fix it in the coming assignments when you learn about states and props.
10. For `Login Page` and `Register Page`, you will create basic login and register forms without any validation. Whenever user clicks on Login and Register buttons in the respective pages, he/she should get redirected to the `Homepage`.
11. For all the other pages, add a simple text specifying which page you are on.
12. Add a navbar to Navigate to all the pages (except the checkout page).
13. Create a new repository on Github and add it as a remote repository to the local repository.
14. Push the code to the remote repository.
15. Create a pull request from `dev` to `master` and Merge the `dev` branch into `master` branch.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€
