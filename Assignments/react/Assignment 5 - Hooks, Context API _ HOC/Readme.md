## The challenge

This is a continuation of `Artwork Gallery` Project (Assignment 4). In this project, you work on hooks.

## Task

1. Create a new branch named `Assignment5` and switch to that branch.
2. You are going to convert all of your class based components into functional components. Replace the lifecycle methods and states into hooks (useState and useEffect).

4. You are going to make use of the API provided to you for fetching products and perfoming actions. All the API endpoints are given in `API.js` file.
5. Make use of context API to store items added to cart and add functions to add item to cart, remove item from cart, change quantity. You can add more functions if needed.
6. Commit and push your code to github.
